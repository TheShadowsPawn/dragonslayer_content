Like giant toads, giant frogs possess a chameleon-like ability to blend into their environment. They prefer to ambush and surprise their prey (1-4 on 1d6).  </p> <p> Giant frogs possess three attack forms. First, they can extend their long tongues 40 feet and strike at +4 to hit and pull their target into their mouth for 1d4 points of damage (per hit die). Second, with a natural 19 or 20 on d20, giant frogs swallow small-sized opponents (halflings, etc.). Those swallowed suffer an automatic 1d4 points of damage per round. Finally, giant frogs may leap-attack 30 feet with a +1 to hit bonus. </p>","alignment":"N","xp":"96","treasure":{"table":"","type":"None"},"appearing":{"d":0,"w":0},"morale":"7"},"attacks":"","sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/ds-content/images/monsters/GiantFrog.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Giant Frog","displayName":0,"img":"systems/ds-content/images/tokens/GiantFrog.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"jMyqyhTAi46dbUftB","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false}},"items":[{"_id":"JOyeBqkAP2ht88M8h","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"","description":"Bite","damage":"3d4","bonus":0,"tags":[{"title":"melee","value":"melee"}],"slow":false,"missile":"false","melee":"true","cost":0,"equipped":false,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":1,"max":1}},"sort":10000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dsl/assets/default/weapon.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"P4Vrh5fl8O10TjWSN","name":"Tongue","type":"weapon","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"","description":"Tongue","damage":"3d4","bonus":4,"tags":[{"title":"missile","value":"missile"}],"slow":false,"missile":"true","melee":"false","cost":0,"equipped":false,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":1,"max":1}},"sort":20000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dsl/assets/default/weapon.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"V13hZLg7XccVLnTvZ","name":"Leap","type":"weapon","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"","description":"Leap","damage":"3d4","bonus":1,"tags":[{"title":"missile","value":"missile"}],"slow":false,"missile":"true","melee":"false","cost":0,"equipped":false,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":1,"max":1}},"sort":30000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dsl/assets/default/weapon.png","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}
