Caliburn can cause double-rolled damage (2d8) to undead once per day (for 10 rounds). Caliburn can Bless his wielder once per day as a Level 4 Cleric. Caliburn’s personality is a double-edged sword. He possesses the strongest of righteous ideals and a paladin’s sense of self-importance. To Caliburn, the world exists only in black and white. He will spur on his wielder and be encouraging. On the other hand, he cannot abide the presence of undead and may force his wielder into action if s/he refuses to engage them. He will never agree to flee, but having the right wielder is ultimately more important than his vanity. He is so conceited that he will refuse to communicate with anyone except a paladin or a lawful good cleric (in the latter case he will demand to be taken to the nearest lawful good temple immediately). He may lower his lofty standards to a ranger, subject to the discretion of the Maze Controller. Caliburn should be role-played as smug and sanctimonious - the epitome of paladinhood.</p>","damage":"1d8","bonus":3,"tags":[{"title":"Melee","value":"Melee"}],"slow":false,"missile":false,"melee":true,"cost":0,"equipped":false,"weight":60,"counter":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons\\weapons\\swords\\greatsword-crossguard-embossed-gold.webp","effects":[],"_id":"vzIomiZrZwfZIBwb"}
