The rod possesses a mace-head at one end and six studs that operate like buttons along its shaft. The device weighs 10 pounds and requires a Strength: 16 or greater to wield. All those below 16 suffer a -1 penalty (per point of Strength). </p> <p>The rod possesses three spell-like abilities (1 charge): </p> <p>1. Fear: At the wielder’s command, the rod emanates a Fear radius (60 feet maximum). All those within the radius are allowed a save (Spell) to negate. </p> <p>2. Paralyzation: Upon touch, or a successful attack, the wielder may paralyze a target. The wielder must indicate this power prior to the attack roll. The target receives a save (Spell) to negate. </p> <p>3. Drain: The rod may drain 2d4 hit points on a successful attack roll (also indicated prior to initiative) and heal the rod-wielder the same amount. </p> <p>The rod also functions as a magic weapon (no charge): </p> <p>In its standard form, the rod functions as a Mace +2. When the Button One is depressed, a blade emerges from the mace head and the rod lengthens into a Longsword +1 Flame Tongue. When Button Two is pushed, a blade springs forth from the side of the mace-head and the rod becomes a Battle Axe +4. When Button Three is pressed, a shaft and steel tip emerges and the rod becomes a Spear +3. The wielder can choose the length of the spear (up to 12 feet). The rod may be used as a lance, if desired. </p> <p>The rod also has the following functions (no charge): </p> <p>Ladder: Button Four allows the wielder to lengthen the rod to 15 feet. The pole hooks at the top and horizontal bars extend to form a ladder. The rod can bear 4,000 pounds firmly and can retract the ladder and pole by depressing Button Five. In this capacity the wielder can force open doors if the butt of the rod is firmly based (+4 to open doors). By depressing Button Six the rod points to polar north and provides the wielder with an approximation of depth underground. </p> <p>A Rod of Lordly Might cannot be recharged. Once the wielder expends its charges, all functions are lost and it reverts to a simple Mace +2. </p>","damage":"1d6","bonus":2,"tags":[{"title":"Melee","value":"Melee"}],"slow":false,"missile":false,"melee":true,"cost":0,"equipped":false,"weight":60,"counter":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons\\weapons\\staves\\staff-orante-gold.webp","effects":[],"_id":"SeirmQdKZ3EehkoQ"}
